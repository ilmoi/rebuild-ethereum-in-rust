Toy project to rebuild a (significantly simplified) version of Ethereum in
rust.

Part of my on-going effort to teach myself rust lang.

Repo contains both the js and rs code. The two should mirror each other. Feel free to fork / use as you please.

Note1: rust code is definitely not production-grade - no edge cases, no error
handling, no proper testing, unwraps() all over the place. I basically only wrote the happy path - not to mention some dubious design/architecture choices...

Note2: js code is not my own. All credit goes to David Joseph Katz and [his
udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-ethereum-from-scratch/). Kudos
for the awesome course dude.
