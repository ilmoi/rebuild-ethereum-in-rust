Simple project to rebuild a (significantly simplified) version of Ethereum in
rust.

Part of my on-going effort to teach myself rust lang.

Note: rust code is definitely not production-grade - no edge cases, no error
handling, no proper testing. I basically only wrote the happy path - not to
mention some dubious design/architecture choices...

Repo contains both the js and rs code. The two should mirror each other. Feel free to fork / use as you please.
